= Gandirb - Ruby lib for using Gandi XML-RPC API

This is a ruby library for using Gandi XML-RPC API.
It should only support the domain and mail API, but may be extensible enough to add hosting in the future.

== Howto

See http://wiki.gandi.net/fr/api-xml/docs/domain for the full documentation on the API.
Note the session_id doesn't have to be explicitly provided when calling a method.

It should also be noted that the ruby xml-rpc lib seems to have a bug with the ssl support, resulting in a timeout of 15 seconds.
After this time the current connection won't work and result in various exception (EOFError, Errno::EPIPE, OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError).
This lib takes this issue into account and provides a workaround (restarting the connection whenever this happens, if necessary).

Quick example :

gandi_session = Gandi::Domain.login 'XXYYY-Gandi', 'mypasswd', Gandi::Domain::TEST_URL #omit the last param for real url
gandi_session.account_currency # => "EUR"
gandi_session.domain_available ["mycoolwebsite.com"] # => {"mycoolwebsite.com"=>true}
gandi_session.domain_list # => ["mypersonalwebsite.com"]

Full RDOC documentation to come.

== TODO

* Tests
* Finish adding and cleaning up domain methods (limit class_eval usage)
